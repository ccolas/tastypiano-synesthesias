# Le Piano Ivre — Synesthesia Archive

This repository contains synesthesias generated by [Le Piano Ivre](https://cedriccolas.com/project/pianocktail), a pianocktail that transforms piano music into cocktail recipes.

## What is a Synesthesia?

Each folder represents a unique moment where music became taste. When someone plays piano (or uploads a recording), _Le Piano Ivre_ analyzes the music and creates a corresponding cocktail recipe capturing the mood of the song.

## Folder Contents

Each synesthesia folder contains:

- **audio.mp3** - The original piano recording
- **music.mid** - MIDI transcription of the performance
- **recipe.png** - The generated cocktail recipe

## The Project

Le Piano Ivre ("The Drunken Piano") is inspired by Boris Vian's novel *L'Écume des jours* (1947), which features a pianocktail — a piano that mixes drinks based on the music played.

This modern interpretation uses machine learning to:
1. Transcribe piano audio to MIDI
2. Extract musical representations
3. Map these to cocktail representations
4. Generate a unique, balanced recipe matching the target cocktail representation
